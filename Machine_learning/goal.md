Based on the experimental design described in the GEO accession GSE99531:

### Research Goals

1. **To Understand the Role of PD-1 Expression Levels in CD8+ T Cells in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**:
   - **Background**: Previous studies in chronic viral infection models suggested that CD8+ T cells with different levels of PD-1 expression might represent distinct states of exhaustion and responsiveness to PD-1 blockade therapies.
   - **Goal**: To investigate if a similar spectrum of exhaustion states based on PD-1 expression exists in T cells within human NSCLC.

2. **To Compare Transcriptional, Metabolic, and Functional Profiles**:
   - **Objective**: To analyze the differences in gene expression, metabolic pathways, and functional capabilities among intratumoral CD8+ T lymphocyte populations with high, intermediate, and no PD-1 expression in NSCLC.

3. **To Identify Biomarkers Predictive of Response to PD-1 Blockade Therapy**:
   - **Aim**: To discover if the presence of certain CD8+ T cell subsets (e.g., PD-1 high) can predict the clinical response and survival benefit in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 blockade.

### Experimental Steps

1. **Sample Collection and Sorting**:
   - **Collection**: Intratumoral CD8+ T cells were collected from 11 NSCLC patients.
   - **Sorting**: These cells were sub-sorted into three categories based on PD-1 expression levels: high (PD-1T), intermediate (PD-1N), and negative (PD-1-).

2. **High Throughput Sequencing**:
   - **Method**: Utilizing Illumina HiSeq4000 for sequencing.
   - **Purpose**: To obtain comprehensive gene expression profiles of the sorted T cell subsets.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Transcriptional Analysis**: Comparing gene expression levels across the three sorted groups to identify distinct transcriptional profiles.
   - **Metabolic Profiling**: Examining differences in metabolic pathways, which could be linked to the functional state of the T cells.
   - **Functional Assessment**: Analyzing the capability of these cells to produce cytokines, their tumor recognition efficiency, etc.

4. **Comparative Analysis with Control Group**:
   - **Control Samples**: Peripheral blood effector memory T cells from healthy donors.
   - **Purpose**: To establish baseline expressions and functions for comparison.

5. **Correlational Studies**:
   - **Clinical Correlation**: Examining the relationship between the presence of these T cell subsets and patient response to PD-1 blockade therapy.
   - **Survival Analysis**: Assessing whether the T cell profiles correlate with overall survival rates in treated patients.

6. **Data Interpretation and Hypothesis Formation**:
   - **Biological Significance**: Understanding the biological implications of the distinct PD-1 expression levels in CD8+ T cells in the context of NSCLC.
   - **Potential Therapeutic Avenues**: Exploring new strategies for enhancing the efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapy based on the findings.
